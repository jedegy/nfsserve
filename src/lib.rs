//! NFSServe - A Network File System (NFS) server implementation in Rust
//!
//! This library provides a complete implementation of the NFS version 3 protocol
//! as defined in RFC 1813, allowing any Rust application to expose file systems
//! over the network to NFS clients.
//!
//! ## Supported Features
//!
//! - Full NFSv3 protocol implementation (all 21 procedures defined in RFC 1813)
//! - MOUNT protocol for filesystem exports
//! - PORTMAP protocol for service discovery
//! - TCP and UDP transport protocols
//! - Asynchronous operation with Tokio runtime
//! - Virtual File System abstraction for implementing custom backends
//!
//! ## Main Components
//!
//! - `vfs`: The Virtual File System API that must be implemented to create a custom NFS-exportable
//!   file system. This abstracts the underlying storage from the NFS protocol details.
//!
//! - `tcp`: TCP-based server implementation that handles client connections and dispatches
//!   NFS protocol requests to the appropriate handlers.
//!
//! - `protocol`: Internal module that implements the NFS, MOUNT, and PORTMAP protocols,
//!   including XDR (External Data Representation) encoding/decoding.
//!
//! - `fs_util`: Utility functions for working with file systems.
//!
//! ## Standards Compliance
//!
//! This implementation follows these RFCs:
//! - RFC 1813: NFS Version 3 Protocol Specification
//! - RFC 1831: RPC: Remote Procedure Call Protocol Specification Version 2
//! - RFC 1832: XDR: External Data Representation Standard
//! - RFC 1833: Binding Protocols for ONC RPC Version 2
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To create an NFS server, implement the `NFSFileSystem` trait and use the `NFSTcpListener`
//! to expose it over the network.
