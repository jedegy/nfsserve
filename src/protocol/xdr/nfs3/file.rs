//! Module contains XDR data structures related to file operations for NFS version 3 protocol
//! as defined in RFC 1813.
//!
//! This module includes data structures for the following operations:
//! - READ: Read data from a file (procedure 6)
//! - WRITE: Write data to a file (procedure 7)
//! - COMMIT: Commit asynchronously written data to stable storage (procedure 21)
//! - LINK: Create a hard link (procedure 15)
//!
//! The structures implement the XDR serialization/deserialization interfaces for
//! the request arguments and response data of these operations.

// Allow unused code warnings since we implement the complete RFC 1813 specification,
// including procedures that may not be used by all clients
#![allow(dead_code)]
// Preserve original RFC naming conventions (e.g. READ3args, COMMIT3resok)
// for consistency with the NFS version 3 protocol specification
#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]
