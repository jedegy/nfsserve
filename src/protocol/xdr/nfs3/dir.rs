//! Module contains XDR data structures related to directories for NFS version 3 protocol
//! as defined in RFC 1813.
//!
//! This module includes data structures for the following directory operations:
//! - MKDIR: Create a directory (procedure 9)
//! - SYMLINK: Create a symbolic link (procedure 10)
//! - READDIR: Read from a directory (procedure 16)
//! - READDIRPLUS: Extended read from a directory (procedure 17)
//! - MKNOD: Create a special device (procedure 11)
//!
//! These structures implement the XDR serialization/deserialization interfaces for
//! the request arguments and response data of directory-related operations.

// Allow unused code warnings since we implement the complete RFC 1813 specification,
// including procedures that may not be used by all clients
#![allow(dead_code)]
// Preserve original RFC naming conventions (e.g. READDIR3args, MKDIR3resok)
// for consistency with the NFS version 3 protocol specification
#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]
