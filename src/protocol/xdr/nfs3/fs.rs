//! This module implements file system operation types defined in RFC 1813 (NFS Version 3 Protocol)
//! for operations related to file system information and statistics.
//!
//! It includes data structures for the following operations:
//! - FSSTAT: Get file system statistics (procedure 18)
//! - FSINFO: Get file system information (procedure 19)
//! - PATHCONF: Get path configuration information (procedure 20)
//!
//! These structures implement the XDR serialization/deserialization interfaces for
//! file system information requests and responses.

// Allow unused code since we implement the complete RFC specification
#![allow(dead_code)]
// Preserve original RFC naming conventions for consistency with the specification
#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]
