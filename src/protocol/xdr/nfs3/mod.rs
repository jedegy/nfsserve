//! The module defines XDR data types and constants for Network File System (NFS)
//! version 3, as defined in RFC 1813.
//!
//! NFS version 3 is a stateless distributed file system protocol
//! that provides transparent remote access to shared file systems over a network.
//! This implementation provides the data structures needed for encoding and
//! decoding NFS version 3 protocol messages using XDR (External Data Representation).
//!
//! This module defines the constants, basic data types, and complex structures
//! that form the foundation of the NFSv3 protocol as specified in RFC 1813.

// Allow unused code since we're implementing the full NFS3 protocol specification
#![allow(dead_code)]
// Preserve original RFC naming conventions for consistency with the specification
