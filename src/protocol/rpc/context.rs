//! RPC context implementation for maintaining server and client state.
//!
//! The Context module provides the state management infrastructure needed for
//! handling RPC requests. It encapsulates all information required for:
//!
//! - Client identification and authentication
//! - Access to file system resources
//! - Tracking of client sessions and requests
//! - Mount status monitoring
//!
//! This module serves as a bridge between the RPC layer and the underlying
//! file system, providing each protocol handler with the information it needs
//! to process requests correctly in accordance with client permissions and
//! server configuration.

/// The Context structure encapsulates all the state information needed to process
/// an RPC request, including client identification, authentication credentials,
/// server configuration, and access to the virtual file system.
///
/// This context is passed to all protocol handlers (NFS, MOUNT, PORTMAP), providing
/// them with the information necessary to authenticate, authorize, and execute
/// requested operations. It serves as a bridge between the RPC layer and the
/// underlying file system implementation.
///
/// Each RPC connection maintains its own Context instance, ensuring proper isolation
/// between different client sessions and enabling accurate tracking of client state.
