//! Transaction tracking for RPC idempotency as described in RFC 1057.
//!
//! This module implements the idempotency requirements for RPC by tracking
//! transaction state using transaction IDs (XIDs) and client addresses.
//! It ensures that:
//!
//! - Duplicate requests due to network retransmissions are properly identified
//! - Only one instance of a given RPC request is processed
//! - Transaction state is maintained for a configurable period to handle delayed retransmissions
//! - Server resources are managed efficiently by cleaning up expired transaction records
//!
//! The transaction tracking system is essential for maintaining the at-most-once
//! semantics required by NFS and other RPC-based protocols, where duplicate
//! operations (like file writes) could cause data corruption.
