//! MOUNT protocol implementation for NFS version 3 as specified in RFC 1813 Appendix I.
//!
//! The MOUNT protocol is used by NFS clients to:
//! - Obtain the initial file handle for a file system exported by the server
//! - Get a list of available exports from the server
//! - Notify the server when a mounted file system is no longer in use
//!
//! This module implements all 6 procedures defined in the MOUNT version 3 protocol:
//!
//! 1. NULL - Do nothing (ping server)
//! 2. MNT - Mount a file system and get its root file handle
//! 3. DUMP - List all mounted file systems (not implemented)
//! 4. UMNT - Unmount a file system
//! 5. UMNTALL - Unmount all file systems
//! 6. EXPORT - List available exports
//!
//! The MOUNT protocol serves several important purposes in the NFS ecosystem:
//! - Provides initial file system access through authenticated file handles
//! - Enables servers to track which clients have mounted their file systems
//! - Allows for graceful unmounting notification to release server resources
//! - Supports discovery of all available file systems through the EXPORT procedure
//!
//! RFC 1813 Appendix I defines the MOUNT protocol as an essential companion
//! to the main NFS protocol. It is typically used during the client's initialization
//! sequence before any NFS operations can occur.

/// Main handler for MOUNT protocol
///
/// Dispatches MOUNT protocol RPC calls to appropriate procedure handlers.
/// Provides operations for mounting, unmounting and export listing.
/// Used by clients to obtain initial file handles for file system access.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `xid` - RPC transaction ID from the client
/// * `call` - The RPC call body containing program, version, and procedure numbers
/// * `input` - Input stream for reading procedure arguments
/// * `output` - Output stream for writing procedure results
/// * `context` - Server context containing exports and VFS information
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Result<(), anyhow::Error>` - Ok(()) on success or an error
